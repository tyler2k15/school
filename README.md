      - Assignment:
        - Complete Exercise #2. Create an application class named PhotoDemo that demonstrates the methods of three related classes for a company that develops photographs. Create a class named Photo that includes fields for width and height in inches and properties for each field. Include a protected price field, and set it to $ 3.99 for an 8- inch by 10- inch photo, $ 5.99 for a 10- inch by 12- inch photo, and $ 9.99 for any other size ( because custom cutting is required). The price field requires a get accessor, but no set accessor. Also include a ToString() method that returns a string constructed from the return value of the object's GetType() method and the values of the fields. Derive two subclassesâ€” MattedPhoto and FramedPhoto. The MattedPhoto class includes a string field to hold a color, and the FramedPhoto class includes two string fields that hold the frame's material ( such as silver) and style ( such as modern). The price for a MattedPhoto increases by $ 10 over its base cost, and the price for a FramedPhoto increases by $ 25 over its base cost. Each subclass should include a ToString() method that overrides the parent class version.
